# nfl-play-analysis
Simulated real-time dashboard for NFL play type prediction and visual analysis using machine learning and computer vision.

## torch requirements
This dashboard was developed using torch==2.7.0+cu118 for GPU acceleration with CUDA 11.8, but is compatible with CPU-only environments using any torch>=2.0. 

## Final Report 
There is a final report for my senior project in the form of a pdf, located in docs.

## Example Outputs
There are 5 examples of dashboard outputs in the form of mp4 files, located in dashboard_examples.

Each example illustrates:
 
- Play type prediction (Run vs Pass)
- Pre-snap detection and role assignment 
- Post-snap player tracking and route visualization
